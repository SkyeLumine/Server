This Server is to be a basic implementation of a RuneScape server but can be stripped of its command-processing
to be used as a general-purpose server. A general-purpose server should have the minimal functionality of receiving
and communicating messages to its clients. Processing of specific messages should be streamlined. (Perhaps handled by
adding an enum element to be used in a switch statement that will execute the desired behavior.).

A Runescape server maintains up-to-date game state for all clients and reflects this information back to clients. The
Server is responsible for validating all game-state related requests to ensure they abide by the game's rules. The
game-state request requirements for this project are:
    1. Clients should be able to send chat messages that can be received by all other clients.
    2. Clients can "click" on their screen to move their character.
    3. More to come...
